# Project Overview

This is a test project created to showcase my skills as a frontend developer.

## Getting Started

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
